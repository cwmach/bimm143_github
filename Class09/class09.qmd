# What is in the PDB anyway?

Let's begin by seeing what is in this database:
```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("PDB.csv", row.names = 1)
head(pdbstats)
```

# Q1. What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

```{r}
n.xray <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",pdbstats$X.ray)))
n.em <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",pdbstats$EM)))
n.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", pdbstats$Total)))
p.xray <- (n.xray/n.total)*100
p.em <- (n.em/n.total)*100
round(p.xray,2)
round(p.em,2)
```
There are `r round(n.xray)` protein structures (`r round(p.xray,2)`%) and `r n.em` (`r round(p.em,2)`%) EM structures in the current PDB database

# Q2. What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
174642/sum(n.total)
```
0.87 of structures in the PDB are protein.

#Q3 Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

There are 240 HIV-1 protease structures in the current PDB

## Working with structure data in R

We will use the `bio3d` package for this 
```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

Read a PDB file from the online database.

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

What is the first residue 3 letter code
```{r}
pdb$atom$resid[1]
aa321(pdb$atom$resid[1])
```
# Q7. How many amino acid residues

198 amino acid residues

# Q8. Name one of the two non-protein residues?

MK1

# Q9. How many protein chains are in this structure?

2 protein chains

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

# Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on Bioconductor and not on Cran

msa is the package that is found on bioconductor

# Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?

Grantlab/bio3d-view is found on bitbucket and not Bioconductor or Cran

# Q12.  True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket?

True

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```
# Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence?

The sequence is 214 amino acids long.

```{r}
# Blast or hmmer search 
#b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```
I could save and load my blast results next time so I don't need to run the search every time.

```{r}
#saveRDS(b, file="blast_results.RDS")
```

```{r}
b <- readRDS("blast_results.RDS")
```

```{r}
#Plot a summary of search results
hits <- plot(b)
```

```{r}
hits$pdb.id
```

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

Next we are going to align and superpose all these structures

```{r}
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile = "msa")
pdbs
```
```{r}
# Vector containing PDB codes for figure axis
ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)

# Draw schematic alignment
#plot(pdbs, labels=ids)
```

```{r}
anno <- pdb.annotate(ids)
unique(anno$source)
```

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
plot(pc.xray, 1:2)
```
Let's cluster our structures
```{r}
# Calculate RMSD
rd <- rmsd(pdbs)

# Structure-based clustering
hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd <- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)
```

And now my graph is colored by groups.

```{r}
plot(pc.xray, 1:2, col="grey50", bg=grps.rd, pch=21, cex=1)
```

```{r}
# Visualize first principal component
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```

We can now open this trajectory in Molstar.
